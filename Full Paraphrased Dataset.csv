suffering from anxiety restlessness and taking clonazepam & mirtazapine. i had depression & panic attacks for the last 7 years. need a second opinion.,"I'm on clonazepam and mirtazapine for anxiety and restlessness. For the past seven years, I've suffered from depression and panic attacks. I'm looking for a second opinion.",depression anxiety restlessness and panic attacks are best respond to a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and benzodiazepines. mirtazapine is not the most efficient ant depressant and it is not a true ssri as fluoxetine paroxetine citalopram and sertraline are. i recommend 20 to 40mg of paroxetine (slowly titrated up from 10mg) and 1mg of either clonazepam or ativan (lorazepam) every 8 hours as needed for anxiety. glaucoma precludes use of any anticholinergics such as hydroxyzine or benadryl (diphenhydramine). ssris are also at times likely to make glaucoma worse but a preliminary trial is always worth it. revert back to a psychiatrist online for further help --> <link>

other than baclofen which medicine can be used for muscle stiffness?,What other medications should be used to treat muscle stiffness besides baclofen?,thank you for the detailed information. i am happy to see your father improve gradually. here is what i suggest. there is no other medicine for stiffness. however physiotherapy should be carried out aggressively to prevent worsening of stiffness. one should rule out infection of the bed sore. if there is infection antibiotics are needed and rarely surgical debridement might be indicated. if there is no infection you can also apply phenytoin powder on the bed sore. the powder helps to hasten the healing process. i do see that there are chances of improvement. but i believe that he will not be able to do his daily activities independently and will remain dependent on others. in the latest scan i see that there is hydrocephalus also called post traumatic hydrocephalus. if the craniotomy flap is tense and there is increase in the water content in the brain he will benefit from ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery to relieve the water accumulation in the brain. this surgery can be done by the same neurosurgeon who performed the first surgery. i cannot comment whether he will be able to speak or not. all i can say is that he might improve in his sensorium (consciousness) some more. for further information consult a neurosurgeon online --> <link>
my fiance is having diabetes type 2. will she face any problem during pregnancy?,My fiance suffers from type 2 diabetes. Will she have any issues while pregnant?,i read through your query and understood your concern. she can take progesterone tablets (medroxyprogesterone 10mg twice daily) to postpone her period. these tablets may increase the requirement of antidiabetic medicines (tablets/insulin). so she needs to monitor her blood sugar level (at least two/three times during the period she is taking tablets) to make sure that sugar control is fine. contraceptive pills used nowadays are low dose pills and have little/no impact on diabetes. even if sugar levels increase it can be treated by increasing the dose of antidiabetic medicines. so she can use low dose contraceptive pills. just consult your physician once before starting those pills to make sure that the medicines do not interact with each other. during pregnancy - if her sugar control is fine from 3 months before pregnancy during pregnancy and till delivery of baby there will practically be no problem to the mother and baby. if sugar control is not good there may be many problems about which there is no need to worry right now. revert back to a gynaecologist online for further queries --> <link>

i am facing premature ejaculation. how do i overcome it?,Premature ejaculation is a problem for me. What should I do to get rid of it?,i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online --> <link>

my friend's son has been diagnosed with hypochondroplasia. kindly suggest the best treatment.,Hypochondroplasia has been diagnosed in the son of one of my friends. Please advise on the appropriate course of action.,hypochondroplasia is a rare and genetically inherited condition. it involves the skeletal system and the child's height and weight are definitely low. and birth history also suggests some abnormality. what about the parents status is anyone affected or are they normal? very rare tests have been performed and he has been examined at reputed institutes and already seen by genetic specialist. the child needs a multispeciality/multidisciplinary approach: 1. he might not reach normal height. there is no specific treatment for that. growth hormone which we use in other conditions would not help him. there are some limb lengthening surgeries done later in life. these are complex surgeries which involves orthopaedics and should be done in multispeciality setups. some other movement restrictions can occur at elbows/knees and these can be managed by orthopaedicians and helped by physiotherapists. 2. enlarged head due to more fluid in the brain. this rarely requires surgery and can be done by a neurosurgeon. mri brain does not show any such features now. if any symptoms appear then probably he will need a repeat mri. 3. fits occur in a few children. this can be treated at any children's centre and can be seen by a paediatrician or a neurologist. 4. with respect to the development special teaching/training programs might be required. psychological support is needed as the child grows up which can be rendered by a child psychologist/psychiatrist. 5. hearing problems are frequent and hence get regular check ups done by an ent specialist/paediatrician who will guide you. unfortunately there are no medications to cure this disease. genetic disorders can affect many body systems. the best we can do is treat the symptoms that are caused. there are more severe forms of the disease which can be life threatening. hypochondroplasia is only a milder form. hope this information is helpful. be in regular follow up with a paediatrician online who will guide to the concerned specialist when required --> <link>

are high sugar and raised liver enzymes side effects of protonix?,Protonix has been linked to high blood sugar and elevated liver enzymes.,is this the only liver function test you have? i wanted to trend it. plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) and protonix (pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test but it is relatively rare with protonix. i also want to make sure that you are not using aspirin tylenol or cholesterol medications since they can have direct effects on the liver. another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis which again could be a rare side effect of protonix. but this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. a person who has prediabetes may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. i was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. for high blood sugars i would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet soda bakery products white bread or pasta and juices. hydrate yourself with plenty of water. can you please share your symptoms and for how long did you have them? please also share if you have been worked up for lupus or autoimmune hepatitis and your entire medication list if you can? revert back with the details to an internal medicine physician online --><link>

can fungal infection cause low grade fever?,Can a fungus cause a low-grade fever?,this is a chronic fever which is called as pyrexia of unknown origin when we are unable to ascertain a cause. as your blood tests and x-ray are normal lung infection is ruled out. conditions causing chronic fever are numerous. also certain infections like tuberculosis hiv and malignancies can cause it. but in your case it is unlikely as there is no weight loss or other risk factors neither you have an x-ray abnormality. now we move to the lymph nodes. do you have any lymph node swelling? if yes then get it tested. try to get an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out lymphadenopathy. get a urine routine and culture as sometimes a mild urine infection can get unnoticed and cause fever. get a blood glucose and renal function test too. if everything comes normal then we should look for anemia. a low hemoglobin can cause low grade fever and fatigue. fungal infections usually cause severe illness. to confirm if it is a fungal infection a blood culture is required. for further information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>

if someone with a fungal infection swims in a pool won't it spread to others through the water?,"Isn't it true that if anyone has a fungal infection and swims in a pool, the infection will spread to others through the water?",i understand your concern. swimming is considered as a safe recreational activity. but that is not totally true. chlorination of water is known to kill most of the microorganisms (which include bacteria viruses fungi and parasites). but there are several factors to be considered like: 1) type of microorganism (some organisms may be resistant to chlorination). 2) adequate chlorination (if sufficient chlorine is not added there could be a chance of acquiring infection). 3) duration of chlorination (when a microorganism is introduced into the water the chlorine may not kill the organism right away some resistant organisms may survive longer in the water). 4) microbial load (the stage of infection of the infected person is also important during the acute acute/highly infective stage chances of spreading infection may be higher). it is very important for people with skin infections or diarrhoea to stay away from the pools for a period of 14days after recovery. this can only be monitored by the people entering the pool themselves. if you are swimming regularly try not to swallow water while swimming. take a shower immediately after swimming. if you develop any symptoms like rashes over the skin or diarrhoea consult your doctor immediately. request the pool authorities to put up a notice requesting members to stay away from the pool if they are sick. if you have kids who are swimming follow the same advice and change their nappies immediately after swimming. also take your kids to the toilet every 30 minutes during their swimming session to prevent them from excreting in the pool. consult a general practitioner online for further follow up ---><link>

can diabetes make my hands itchy and numb?,Is it possible for diabetes to make my hands itchy and numb?,i am sorry to know that despite the best efforts you are not responding with current antidepressants and there are active symptoms. i suggest the following treatment given a diagnosis of diabetes with depression. tablet duloxetine (duzela m) 30 mg in the morning and 30 mg in the evening. the reason for recommending this medicine is because it is quite effective for pain symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy along with depression. tablet aripiprazole (arpizol) 5 mg in the morning. although it comes from an antipsychotic group of medicines my purpose here is to augment the action of antidepressants while addressing anger associated with depression. tablet lonazep (clonazepam) can be continued as per the current level if there is adequate sleep. in case sleep has been an issue despite the medicines i will recommend upping the dose of lonazep to 0. 5 mg at bedtime. regarding vilazodone i think it should be removed as it is causing intolerable side effects. also this particular antidepressant has little role in pain associated with neuropathy and i think duloxetine will be a better option. there is need to stop tobacco. this is because many of the medicines mentioned above have poor efficacy when tobacco is consumed. you need to consult your diabetes doctor as poor control of diabetes could be a significant reason for the poor response. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. in case you have more questions feel free to write back to me. for further queries consult an andrologist online --> <link>

please suggest some exercise and supplement for weak bones.,Please recommend some bone-building exercises and supplements.,i have understood your concern. dislocation is accidental slippage of bone from the actual space and when it happens it will make surrounding muscles ligaments and capsule over stretch and so ultimately pain will be due to all structures. first you need to strengthen the surrounding muscles perfectly with the faith that you will improve. it may take six months or more. do not worry about it and you need to have more patience. in supervision of skilled physiotherapist you need to do all exercise. you can take some pain relieving modalities like ift and swd therapies (interferential therapy and short wave diathermy) by which pain intensity will decrease. but this is not a permanent option. non-vegetarian food will not affect much. i insist to rely on pure vegetarian protein and calcium diet. take bananas and milk as much as possible. avoid junk foods and do proper exercise. for further information consult a fitness expert online --> <link>

how to remove pimples and the scars on my face?,How do I get rid of pimples and scars on my face?,pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. remember the following measures to control pimples. do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods chocolates and milk products. do not use any steroid creams. face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it. regarding treatment of pimple i suggest clindamycin (clintop faceclin or clear gel). this is more of preventive and curative so i tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use adapalene gel (adapalene or differin) over acne in the night. i also suggest you to take tablet doxy (doxycycline) 100 mg once in a day. consult your doctor discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent. if you have acne marks avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. wear sunglass cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time use sunscreen thrice in a day such as 10 am 12 pm and 3 pm. it has to be applied all over the face. sunscreen spf (sun protection factor) should be around 50. use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like kojic acid hydroquinone depiwhite cream etc. in the night. ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. sittings of six to eight peels must be required. post acne scars are three types. box scar ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. no cream or tablet can help you out in scars. best technique is co2 fractional laser and subscision. it takes five to six sitting but results are better than any other procedure. dermaroller and subscision are also other methods but less effective than the above. fillers do have hiding effect. it fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent. if scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective. these are technique you can go through. all procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results. for further information consult a dermatologist online --> <link>

how to confirm my pregnancy?,How do I know if I'm pregnant?,the history typically suggests an implantation bleed but as your dark brown bleed coincides with the menstrual due date. it may have been scanty menses as well. now as you have done the urine pregnancy test after 7 days post missed periods and it was negative it does rule out pregnancy. as you feel that you may still be pregnant the best way is the blood serum beta hcg test (human chorionic gonadotropin) which can be done to allay your doubt. if the beta hcg levels are more than 1 then the pregnancy is confirmed. else if it is less than 1 then it is ruled out completely. the symptoms you are experiencing can be safe attributed to premenstrual syndrome if the test is negative. premenstrual syndrome mimics early pregnancy symptoms like headache nausea sore breasts mild cramps and increased frequency of urination. this may indicate that you may resume your menses in a few days if the beta hcg is negative as well. for further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

my teeth are yellow. is scaling only a temporary process to clean the teeth?,My teeth are yellow. Is scaling just a quick way to clean your teeth?,"yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: 1) tartar or plaque deposits (soft yellowish deposits) on the teeth. 2) calculus deposits (calcified hard deposits) on the teeth. 3) fluorosis - internal discoloration of the teeth due to altered fluorine content in the drinking water. you have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. from your history it is very clear that the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. this gets partially removed with brushing. calculi are hard deposits either yellowish greenish or sometimes blackish in color. they are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. during childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. ""tooth worms"" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. these bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. the lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. at this age of yours these deposits may be due to: 1) improper brushing technique. 2) brushing only once a day. 3) malalignment of your teeth. 4) crowding of your teeth (due to inadequate spacing in between the teeth). 5) if you are having any prosthetic teeth (crown bridge removable appliances). 6) if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment (wire braces). dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. but it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. hence scaling is not a wastage of money it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. so a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: 1) brush with toothpaste and brush twice daily. the head of the toothbrush should be angulated in such a way that it reaches all the teeth and all the interior and hidden parts of the teeth. 2) use an antibacterial mouthwash only for the time period for which the dentist has prescribed. because long term use of mouthwash itself will cause staining of teeth. 3) rinse your mouth thoroughly soon after every meal. 4) in case you are wearing wire braces or prosthesis use the specific tooth brushes (orthodontic toothbrushes) to clean the teeth thoroughly well. 5) use interdental toothbrushes to clean the minute spaces in between the teeth. 6) visit a dentist once in every 6 months and get a scaling done if necessary. as your doctor has told regular use of colgate toothpaste is sufficient. sensodyne toothpaste is not needed for you since it is used for hypersensitive teeth. glodent toothpaste helps in stain removal and it can be used if extrinsic stains are present on the teeth. it does cause teeth whitening. regular use of mouthwash is not essential. you can use hexidine mouthwash for about two weeks and then stop it. bleaching is the procedure used to remove internal or intrinsic staining of the teeth which is not required for you. and finally pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. teeth which are slightly yellow without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. hope this answer helps you. take care. consult a dentist online for further follow up --> <link>"
my mouth stinks very badly. what shall i do?,"My mouth stinks to high heaven. So, what should I do?",get a full mouth scaling done from a dentist. start using antibacterial mouthwash (example: listerine) twice daily for two weeks. this is the best for stinking mouth (bad breath/ halitosis). another method for cure of bad breath is saline mouth rinse. take a small cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and rinse thrice daily for 10 days. you must get the cause identified. treating the root cause will give a permanent solution for bad breath. if the halitosis remains evenafter the use of mouthwash for two weeks consult a dentist online for further treatment.
took urine pregnancy test on the 1st day of missed periods. is that right?,"On the first day of missing periods, I took a urine pregnancy test. Is that correct?",you tested too early with a urine pregnancy test. please wait for three to four days and then retest if period does not start by then. urine pregnancy test though theoretically can give correct result on the day of a missed period practically it is not that sensitive and you need to wait for three or four days extra for beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) to rise enough to be detected by a urine test. another possibility is a genuine negative pregnancy and impending period causing cramps. the second possibility is that of threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy in which case the rise of beta hcg is slow and cannot be detected in urine test so early. it is too early to draw any conclusion and you need to wait for the situation to become clear. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
how to prevent bleeding on brushing?,How do I avoid bleeding while brushing my teeth?,you should use betadine gargle as mouthwash twice daily for 15 days to reduce the swelling of gums and bleeding and also to keep your teeth clean. it would be better if you could go to a dentist for physical evaluation. ask your dentist to do cleaning of your whole mouth (dental scaling) to remove calculus and plaque from your teeth and gums. cleaning will reduce the bleeding and helps to maintain good oral hygiene. try to get your mouth clean routinely every six months to get healthy gums. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>

is it fine to use mifepristone for abortion after c-section?,Is it safe to use mifepristone after a c-section for abortion?,first please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hcg test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. if the hcg levels are more than 5 ng/dl then she is pregnant. in that case as she has been a post c-section case medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either mifepristone or misoprostol simply. because the c-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. the best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. please meet your gynecologist and get the needful. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

i am doing better with my anti-anxiety drug. do i need counseling?,My anti-anxiety medication is helping me a lot. Is it necessary for me to seek counselling?,from your detailed information i feel that you have responded to medication. all ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications tend to over time make the person who takes them more relaxed. this could be attributed to the main task of reducing anxiety. thus maybe a lower dose for a few months may benefit. importantly absence of anxiety or motivation is more troublesome. also i do not think that any counseling will help you. as you are already aware and attend to the problem of not pursuing tasks to completion cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) or nlp (neuro-linguistic programming) or coach may help. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>

seven days since i missed my period. pregnancy tests negative. why?,I haven't had my period in seven days. The pregnancy test came out negative. What is the reason for this?,if you have taken the urine pregnancy test after seven days of missed periods then the results are usually conclusive. you may repeat the test after 48 hours and if it is still negative then you are not pregnant. the delay can possibly be due to stress induced hormonal imbalance especially during this cycle due to stressors which can easily delay your menses. if your menses do not arrive naturally in next one week then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone. a single delayed period is not an indication for infertility workup. repeat the tests and consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
i am not sure if i have rosacea. please help.,I'm not sure whether I suffer from rosacea. Please assist.,rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above 30 years. other than acne like lesions people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. they also have redness and irritation in the eyes. the redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes stress alcohol consumption exercise and spicy food. yours clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above said information. you seem to have acne. the cysts are a part of acne. acne varies in severity from individual to individual. some may have mild acne which may come off and on. others may have almost incessant eruption of acne which may leave behind post acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. for acne you need to be constantly taking care care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. for inflammatory acne (papules and pustules) i advise to start with one of the oral antibiotics either azithromycin doxycycline or minocycline. cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. they are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. you could also take a few peeling sessions like salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. for further follow up consult a dermatologist online --> <link>

can implantable cardioverter defibrillator cause afib?,Afib can be caused by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.,implantable defibrillators are implanted to terminate an episode of atrial arrhythmia. afib (atrial fibrillation) is also a type of atrial arrhythmia. the icd not only provides treatment for atrial arrhythmias but also provides treatment for ventricular arrhythmias as well as rate-responsive dual chamber pacing for the treatment of bradycardia. the pacing attempts to gain control over the arrhythmia by interrupting the pathway of the atrial arrhythmia and uses low energy pacing which is usually goes unnoticed by the patient. in cases when atp (antitachycardia pacing) is successful the patient may not even be aware that they have had an arrhythmia until their device follow-up. so the answer for your question is icd cannot cause atrial fibrillation until and unless it is implanted incorrectly; rather it will terminate an episode of atrial fibrillation automatically. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>

kindly advise regarding my chest pain as the test results are normal.,"Please give me some advice about my chest pain, as the test results are fine.",cardiac origin of chest pain is highly unlikely in a 29 year old female. female has a cardioprotective hormone called estrogen which usually delays the onset of coronary artery disease till 65 years. the pain you get is most likely because of high levels of your anxiety or overthinking. once shunt reversal in pfo (patent foramen ovale) is ruled out then you can ask your cardiologist to start you with a low dose of ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) like paroxetine along with low doses of anti-anxiety medicine benzodiazepine like clonazepam for two to three months. as echo and blood profile is normal it is not cardiac. however you have not mentioned if you are a smoker or alcoholic. is there any family history of early cardiac death? what is the shunt direction in pfo in 2d echo? what are the symptoms of lung congestion? how long does the pain last? what is the frequency of your pain and is it associated with sweating? a thorough history is a must before giving a cardiac clearance. please answer the above. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>

does peanut butter pose any allergy threat?,Is peanut butter a potential allergen?,you have asked an interesting question. peanut allergy is one of the most severe food allergies. it can cause itchiness urticaria swelling eczema sneezing asthma abdominal pain drop in blood pressure and cardiac arrest. it may even result in anaphylactic death if not controlled in the right time. the routes of exposure of the allergen are mostly the accidental ingestion of peanuts or pb by the concerned person (who is hypersensitive to peanuts). air-borne particles in a farm or factory or crushing environment may cause respiratory symptoms in allergic individuals. however the odor of peanut butter or its mere proximity have not produced any allergic symptoms in various studies conducted. hence answering your questions. it is safe to carry peanut butter in plane. if you are carrying it as part of hand baggage (cabin baggage) make sure it is packed properly in a colored container. this is just to prevent any psychogenic allergic symptoms in those susceptible individuals who may see the butter and develop allergy (however such psychogenic reactions are very rare but still documented in studies). since the pb as such is not an allergen by sight/proximity/odor a susceptible person need not take extra precautions to avoid allergy when someone else is carrying pb. however since psychogenic reactions can occur it may be advised that such a susceptible person may change his seat to another seat away from person who is carrying peanut butter. for further information consult an allergic specialist online --> <link>

i have chronic allergies which become worse in winter. please suggest ayurvedic medicine.,"I actually have chronic sensitivities which end up extra regrettable in wintry weather. if its now no longer too tons hassle, propose ayurvedic medicine.",the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up --> <link>
how to cure eye allergy?,the way to repair eye sensitivity?,your doctor is right in saying that your son has allergic conjunctivitis. eye allergies called allergic conjunctivitis are a common condition that occurs when the eyes react to something that irritates them called an allergen. the most common allergens are dust and pollens. the eyes produce a substance called histamine to fight off the allergen. as a result the eyelids and conjunctiva (the thin filmy membrane that covers the inside of your eyelids) become red swollen and itchy with tearing and burning. the key to treating eye allergies are avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. avoid rubbing eyes instead do cold compresses. use antiallergic eye drop like olopatadine along with lubricating eye drop. we prescribe mild steroid in pulse dose in case allergy is severe. in longstanding allergy we also prescribe tacrolimus (talimus ointment) with very good results. some doctors also prescribe cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus and that is also effective in longstanding cases. this will help you and i am very sorry to say that there is no medicine to cure allergy. only way is to stay away from all those things that you are allergic to. also this allergy will trouble him every year and usually after puberty it decreases. for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>

I typically have walking nostril or sore throat or exorbitant sniffling and hacking and cant inhale frequently. kindly assistance.,i totally understand your concern regarding cure of allergies. unfortunately allergy of the nose cannot be totally cured but definitely can be prevented. i would recommend the following:1. get an allergy skin test done; so as to identify the allergen. avoiding the allergen is half the solution to the problem. the allergen source could be dust sources like carpets/bedding/mattresses. avoid indoor plants/pollens. pet fur/hair is also a common cause. 2. get a ct scan of your sinuses. you could be having polyps in your sinuses; which may be contributing to your nose block. if so; your ent doctor may advise you to undergo a surgery to open up your sinuses; to enable you to breathe better. 3. taking a steroid spray regularly will give relief of your symptoms. you do need to take it for 2-3 months during the season. taking an antihistamine like allegra with steroid sprays is beneficial in moderate allergic rhinitis. 4. the latest treatment is immunotherapy; offered in some allergy centres. you can contact your local specialist for the same. it is a permanent cure; but it takes a long time for the immunity to develop. hope the above helps. if you do have a scan do share it with me and i can guide you further. keep your allergies under control; as a neglected sneeze can lead to aggravation of your wheeze. consult an ent otolaryngologist online for further help --> <link>
why does my friend have numbness after hemilaminectomy surgery?,for what cause does my associate have deadness after hemilaminectomy clinical process?,it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. ---> <link>

i have episodes of dull pain over my left eye. what could be causing this?,i've scenes of gloomy ache over my cleared-out eye. what can be inflicting this?,i read your query and understood your concerns. from the available description it is clear that you are having frontal sinusitis which can explain all of your symptoms except tingling sensation in groin. presence of pain on touch (tenderness) pain while in reclining position and coincidence of pain with post-nasal drip favors the clear cut diagnosis. one thing is that the episodic nature of pain which is not common with frontal sinusitis but can occur in few cases. i feel that pain over left eye and tingling sensation is not casually related as there is no condition which can explain both these symptoms on basis of single disease. the one possibility is anxiety associated with recurrent pain can be cause of tingling over the groin area although constant nature of tingling on same location points against anxiety. we can expect that complete neurological examination will reveal the true nature of association. at this moment i must assure you that this is not something serious and get yourself treated for sinusitis to break the event of chains. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>

i have inappropriate sinus tachycardia. should i get a pacemaker?,i've beside the point sinus tachycardia. need to i am getting a pacemaker?,firstly do not get depressed this is not a life-threatening condition and may resolve with time. the symptoms may be troublesome for some time. how much are your resting and maximum heart rate? you should get yourself evaluated by a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression which i think is causing your poor quality of life. i assume all other causes are ruled out like thyroid low hemoglobin and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. the echocardiogram is also normal i guess. in treatment it is better to continue medicines because results of ablation are not very good and it may give rise to a need for a permanent pacemaker. a pacemaker is also not a good option in your age group as strenuous activities and heavy sports need to be restricted after this. besides regular surgeries to replace batteries may be troublesome. so i think you should continue with medicine. i suggest taking beta blockers like metoprolol 25 mg once a day or ciplar la (propranolol) 20 mg once a day. this should be tried rather than ivabradine. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine after their consent. hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. for more information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>

two of my wisdom teeth are impacted. is it better to remove?,of my understanding tooth are impacted. is it higher to get rid of?,cavities or tooth decay is chronic infections that spread further at a slow rate in most cases. the other thing to consider is any pain or associated symptoms with the cavities which are indicative of active acute infection that has already spread deeper. so if the cavities are without symptoms then it would be fine to wait for a few months as well. however depending on the current state of infection which can be evident from x-ray i could give a more conclusive answer. about the wisdom teeth if these are unerupted at your age then it is recommended that you get them removed as they present a chance for cyst formation etc. it is not urgent though. this is more prophylactic than definitive. complications of removing wisdom teeth depend upon the location and position of the wisdom teeth. yes a very small chance for more complications at a later age. but the overall complexity would have been informed by the dentist or oral surgeon already. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>

how many times a day should i brush my teeth?,how typically an afternoon need to i brush my tooth?,welcome to icliniq. com. the best oral hygiene maintenance method is to brush your teeth with a soft or medium toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. the electronic toothbrush does not offer any real additional benefit to normal individuals. it is the movements of the toothbrush made by our hands that bring about thorough cleaning. most of the toothpastes available in the market are good as long as they contain up to 1000 ppm fluoride. brushing three times is good. the main goal is to clean the food deposits from all areas. rinsing the mouth after meals is good yet a simple method to keep the mouth clean. using a mouthwash causes no real problem in relation to upsetting the microflora or healthy bacteria. you can continue to use it once a day. professional cleaning is recommended every 6 to 12 months depending on your plaque and calculus forming tendency. due to plaque deposition over a long period there is temporary decalcification that might occur on the tooth surface. thus on professional cleaning when it is removed there will a slight increased sensitivity. however it does not remove the enamel layer at a significant level. so once we continue to use the fluoride toothpaste with a toothbrush along with natural fluoride in water the tooth surface gets remineralized. and then the sensitivity disappears. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>

i am planing to go for liposuction for weight loss. my weight is 78kgs,i'm planing to move for liposuction for weight reduction. my weight is 78kgs,your bmi - body mass index is 30. 4 kg/m2. generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose bmi is 30 kg/m2 or above. liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. it is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. there is a set point for fat storage for everyone. this is not altered by liposuction. weight loss by liposuction diet control exercise naturopathy amway herbalife etc. is temporary as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. so any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. if you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that. for further information consult a general surgeon online --> <link>
i have chest congestion acid reflux and heartburn. is it gerd or a heart attack?,i've chest congestion acid reflux disease disorder and heartburn. is it gerd or a coronary heart assault?,thanks for your query. let go of your anxiety. gastroesophageal reflux disease is 80 % corrected by simple diet and lifestyle modifications. so i would suggest you try the following. lose your weight. if your bmi (body mass index) is 25 or above you need to lose weight. coffee chocolates citrus juices tomato-based products peppermints onion family beans etc. are some of the food that you need to avoid to relieve the symptoms. if you are fond of eating it is time to stop it. reduce your food intake. instead of increasing the quantity increase the frequency. eat five short meals instead of three bigger ones. if you sleep just after or within three hours of meal intake this habit needs to be stopped. increase the interval. when you sleep elevating the head at least 8 inches would be a good addition to the plan to combat gerd. bending stooping and upside down hangings with all other unnatural postures need to be avoided. your symptoms could also be due to multivitamin deficiency especially vitamin b12 deficiency. hope this helps. for more information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>
what can cause genital numbness?,what can reason genital numbness?,the two most common causes of perineal or genital numbness is compression of the nerves in your spine (called as cauda equina) or compression of the nerves in the perineum itself. only sensory loss is uncommon but still possible in cauda equina syndrome (ces) since it is more commonly associated with other symptoms. compression of nerve in the perineum typically occurs in cyclists. i will suggest you to go to the closest er (emergency room) urgently. you need to be evaluated to reach the correct diagnosis. they may also order an mri for you to identify the exact site of nerve compression since the treatment varies as per the site of compression. delay in treatment may make the symptoms irreversible. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>

my pregnancy test remains positive after abortion. why?,my being pregnant check stays advantageous after abortion. why?,if you had an ectopic pregnancy then it would show on the sonogram. pregnancy test could be positive due to leftover tissue. as it was removed it should be examined by histopathology test. sometimes hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) producing trophoblastic tissue (it is similar to a healthy pregnancy tissue) persists inside uterus giving positive pregnancy tests. if your test comes positive then you should do titer of serum beta-hcg every third day to see if it is rising or falling. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
my iud got displaced and i am late for my periods. does it mean ectopic pregnancy?,my iud were given displaced and i'm past due for my durations. does it imply ectopic being pregnant?,you are missing the most important thing that is the pregnancy test is an error which means it is not positive. of course if iud (intrauterine device) is displaced from the normal position there is a chance of pregnancy and also of tubal ectopic pregnancy. but it is not that all cases have a tubal pregnancy. only after around 14 to 20 days of missed periods you can see the baby's heartbeat on the scan. there is no matter how good the scan is. the thing which you saw could be your heartbeat and it can be mistaken. the red and blue color is doppler scan which just shows the flow of blood to and fro. the most confirmatory test would be serum beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) and this can diagnose a pregnancy no matter how small it is. only when the value goes above 1500 iu/ml the baby's sac can be seen on the scan not before. so you can decide when to scan. the discharge can be the fluid from uterus cavity or cervical canal when the iud came out. fallopian tube swelling on the scan is not very conclusive. for further information consult an obstetrician and obstetrician online --> <link>
am i under correct medication for my symptoms? is it gerd?,am i beneathneath accurate medicine for my signs and symptoms? is it gerd?,from going through the information you have provided it is clear that currently you are on treatment for suspected gerd - gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux disease). you have been having intermittent problems over five years. acid reflux can cause breathlessness and waking up from sleep at night. some might feel and describe heartburns but others may not actually feel the burning sensation. the symptoms can be worsened by stress anxiety and panic attacks. my recommendations are an endoscopy procedure called gastroscopy will help to check for any weakness in the valve at the lower end of the food pipe (gullet or esophagus) and to directly visualize any evidence of inflammation there that is reflux esophagitis. following the above test you may require a 24 hour ph monitoring study and a manometry test to confirm that acid is refluxing back whenever you have symptoms and that there is no problem with motility of the gullet. i agree with you that i would not continue on perinorm cd (metoclopramide). i tend to give it only for nausea or vomiting. nexpro (esomeprazole) 40 mg is best taken once daily in empty stomach in the morning. if despite this symptoms persist it can be taken twice daily before food that is before breakfast and the other before dinner at night. you can take topcid (famotidine) 40 mg at bedtime to prevent symptoms at night. some people with gerd may find that eliminating certain food helps to improve their symptoms. for example avoiding spicy foods raw onion garlic black pepper citrus products and juices of orange grapefruit or cranberry tomato products chocolate or brownies caffeine sodas coffee tea etc. peppermint fatty or greasy foods. eat smaller and frequent meals. try to eat more slowly try to spend at least 30 minutes per meal and avoid eating on the run. avoid large high fat meals. avoid late evening snacks or eating before bed. avoid lying flat after eating; try sitting up for at least two hours after finishing a meal and sleep on your left side. try light walking for 15 to 30 minutes following a meal. try chewing non-mint type chewing gum for 30 minutes following a meal. raise the head of the bed 6 to 8 inches to prevent reflux when sleeping. extra pillows may only elevate your head. try putting pillows under the mattress near the head of the bed or use a special wedge. avoid tight fitting clothes around the abdomen. i wish you a speedy recovery. investigations to be done:1. gastroscopy. 2. 24 hour esophageal ph monitoring and esophageal manometry. probable diagnosis:1. gerd. 2. functional dyspepsia. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. ---> <link>

am i suffering from achalasia or gerd?,am i laid low with achalasia or gerd?,your primary diagnosis is esophageal candidiasis and antral gastritis. these are medical conditions and managed with medical treatment only. although treatment for esophageal candidiasis lasts little long duration. the esophageal manometry test is not required for these conditions and neither for gerd. the esophageal manometry test is to confirm esophageal motility disorder in which esophageal dilatation is common. also these disorders have a common presentation like you difficulty in swallowing. in contrast to the above mentioned conditions achalasia is a surgical condition and requires surgery. yes you require manometry test in suspicion of dilated esophagus. but do this test after completion of treatment for esophageal candidiasis for at least after 15 to 20 days. investigations to be done:upper gi endoscopy and esophageal manometry. probable diagnosis:1. achalasia cardia. 2. esophageal dysmotility syndrome. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. ---> <link>
my friend is suffering from neuropathic pain after a thalamic stroke. please help.,my pal is laid low with neuropathic ache after a thalamic stroke. please assist.,thalamus is the part of the brain through which all sensory information is relayed. after a stroke involving the thalamus many times the patient develops thalamic pain syndrome which is very poorly responsive to medications. but as you told that it was relieved to some extent by gabapentin and the patient has already tried pregabalin and carbamazepine with no improvement. so in such case trial of a new medicine can be given in a hope to get some betterment. for the spasticity the patient is already on lioresal. if that is not showing any improvement then injection botox (botulinium toxin) in the stiff muscles of the left hand can be tried. but it is a costly injection and is needed to be repeated every 4 to 6 months. i suggest trying tablet duloxetine 30 mg twice daily. it is effective for pain and also for depression. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. for more information consult a neurologist online --> <link>

how to avoid ectopic pregnancy?,the way to keep away from ectopic being pregnant?,if tuberculosis have not done irreversible damage to the tube and endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) then pregnancy can happen either naturally or with treatment. a simplest way to check these two things is one mid-cycle ultrasound (around day 13 or 14 of menses) to see the uterine lining (anything more than 8 mm to 9 mm should be reassuring) and one tubal patency test like hsg (hysterosalpingogram). in case of damaged or blocked tubes ivf would be a better option (in vitro fertilization) as it will also reduce the chance of ectopic pregnancy. for further information consult an infertility specialist online --> <link>
my mother suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and she is in a coma. can she recover?,my mom suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and he or she is in a coma. can she recover?,the neurological deficit in a patient who suffered from hemorrhagic stroke depends on the areas of the brain affected and the pressure from the edema. the tube in the brain (external ventricular drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt) are management for that edema pressure. with time that blood starts to reabsorb. some part of the brain might get permanently damaged and the remaining part may begin to take up the functions of damaged part (plasticity of the brain). but this process is very slow and may take few months too. until that time the supportive care has to be continued like medical management physiotherapy nursing care bladder bowel and back care. i would like to see the ct or mri images eeg along with hospital case summary for better judgment. revert with more information to a neurologist online --> <link>

will i get an ectopic pregnancy if i had sex on the date of period?,Would I have an ectopic pregnancy if I had sex on my period's due date?,firstly as you had bleeding after eight days post unwanted 72 intake it ensures that you are not pregnant. your fresh menstrual date would now be the date of the bleeding started after the ecp (emergency contraceptive pill). there is a likelihood that next menses may be delayed by a week to 10 days which is a known side effect of unwanted 72. neatly it is not an ectopic pregnancy. but the chance of endometriosis rises if intercourse is undertaken during menstrual bleed which can later lead to ectopic if endometriosis gets severe. if still you wish to conclusively rule out pregnancy then you may get a serum beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) test done. if the hcg levels are less than 3 miu/ml then you are surely not pregnant. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
i feel numbness in penis. is it due to nerve impingement?,I'm experiencing numbness in my penis. Can nerve impingement be the reason?,this is a localized numbness that we are bothered with. disease starting from this region without any other associated symptoms is quite rare and without them we may not think of a systemic pathology right away. have you tried nerve tonics? i suggest back strengthening exercises and pregabalin 75 mg once a day for two weeks. vitamin b12 levels and hba1c should be helpful. consult a specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. lack of erections may suggest a more systemic disease but we need to have more a detailed talk before we can attribute symptoms. for further information consult a urologist online --> <link>
can uterine fibroid be cured without surgery?,Is it possible to get rid of a uterine fibroid without surgery?,the heavy bleeding may be due to the fibroid and menopausal symptoms. hence we need to treat fibroid and hormonal imbalance. for your condition i suggest you try taking the following medicines. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. tablet aloes compound two tablets thrice a day. capsule rasagandhi mezhugu one tablet twice a day. tablet chitramoola kuligai one tablet twice a day. you need to continue these drugs for three months. within one week the bleeding will stop. then gradually the uterine fibroid will be reduced in size. after few more months your uterus will become normal. if you can collect or buy the bark of jambul tree crush 50 gm of the bark with 300 ml of water. boil in mild flame and reduce it to 50 ml. then drink it. this should be consumed in the morning and evening on an empty stomach. this has the potential to stop the excess bleeding. use banana flower in cooking. it is also good to control uterine bleeding. another option is using hormones given by a gynecologist but that should be your last option. this drug gives only symptomatic relief it does not reduce the fibroid uterus size. for more information consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>
i have gerd. please help.,I have gerd.Please assist.,at the age of 24 year it is unlikely that you have ulcer in the stomach. it could be gerd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) that is causing all these symptoms but after long time it may cause ulcer. if you are not responding to ppis (proton-pump inhibitors) then it could be h. pylori infection that is causing the problem. the investigations you have mentioned are not having much abnormalities except mild anaemia. the management of gerd symptoms include medicines as well as dietary modifications and exercise with position maneuvers. usually we do not do investigations but if it is not responding to medicines then it is needed. advice:tablet omeprazole 20mg twice a day half an hour before food intake. syrup gelusil 5ml along with food (you can take every time) continue it till you have pain and heartburn. tablet amoxicillin 1000mg twice a day for 15 days. tablet clarithromycin 500mg twice a day for 15 days. avoid oily and spicy meal coffee and tea. do exercise daily (walking or jogging). take small and frequent meals. avoid liqiuds prefer solid and semisolid food especially before sleep. sleep in left lateral position with elevation of head end. you have anaemia so please take iron and folic acid (100mg iron combination) once daily. these disorders have great relation to behaviour and mood changes so please alleviate any tension. get thyroid function test (tft) and fasting glucose level done. do not quit your job instead work with more energy and enthusiasm. i have provided the treatment plan with medicines and other measures for 15 days. revert back to a medical gastroenterologist online --> <link>

i have numbness in my left foot. what could have caused this?,What might be the reason for this?,you have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. being an orthopaedic surgeon i may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. my guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. i need to know from you: whether you have any back pain? is there any radiating pain from the spine region all along the course of your limb? apart from numbness are there any other symptoms of neurological involvement like weakness paresthesias burning sensations etc. also present? if the answers to above questions are no my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin along with vitamin b 12 supplementation and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). in case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase then i suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology. get back to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online for further queries --> <link>
which is a better birth control pill than ortho-cyclen?,What birth control pill is superior to ortho-cyclen?,i think you should first get investigated for the cause of heavy bleeding. get your routine blood tests like cbc (complete blood count) blood sugar thyroid profile coagulation profile and liver function tests along with a scan of abdominal organs and pelvis. if you have problem with estrogen and progesterone combination which is present in tablet ortho-cyclen then you can start with progesterone tablets containing norethisterone from day 5 to 25 continuously for control of bleeding. another best way for this treatment as well as birth control is the use of mirena (levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device). you can discuss this with your doctor. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
having on and off heavy bleeding other than normal menstruation. why?,"Other than usual menstruation, I've been getting on and off heavy bleeding.

will taking sysron ncr prevent pregnancy?,Is sysron ncr effective in preventing pregnancy?,sysron ncr (norethisterone) is basically a hormone which is used to control heavy bleeding during periods. i am afraid that sysron ncr does not have any contraceptive action in it. you must take precautions to not get pregnant during its use. your partner can use barrier methods like condoms. you can also try oral contraceptive pills which will also bring down the flow during your period. it will act in two ways. contraception regularizing your cycle and bringing down flow. you must take doctor's advise before starting any new drug. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
what should i do for heavy bleeding following i-pill?,What do I do if I experience heavy bleeding after taking the i-pill?,the fact that the menses have started after 10 days of i-pill intake ensures that there is no pregnancy. the pain and heavy bleeding are secondary to the progesterone effect of the high dose progesterone pill like i-pill. it is suggested that you should take tablet trapic-mf (tranexamic acid) twice a day for next three days. this should take care of pain and bleeding. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. you may increase your water intake and use hot fomentation locally to reduce pain as well. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

can i have root canal treatment for cracked molar?,May I get a root canal for a broken molar?,i have read through your complaint and the relevant details. a cracked tooth can be root canal treated depending on the direction of the crack within the tooth especially if it involves the vital part of the tooth called the pulp. the pulp is the vital part. when it is inflamed or infected you get pain. so in this case root canal treatment will help you get rid of the pain. it is in this sequence that the treatment should have gone. first root canal treatment then crown lengthening and then temporary crown followed by a permanent crown. but the pain you experience at the moment seems to occur because of increased height in the temporary crown. it can be corrected by shaping the portion of the crown which gets hit first when you bite. the reason for the general pain is again the same one. the decision of whether root canal treatment has to be done or not can be confirmed only with an x-ray. hence i am unable to say you without witnessing the x-ray of the tooth. i request you to send me the x-rays if you have any. it will help me give you a better answer. revert with x-rays to a dentist online --> <link>

i get headaches when i go out in the sun. please suggest some ayurvedic cure.,"When I'm out in the heat, I get headaches. Please recommend an ayurvedic treatment.",the symptoms you have mentioned here are indicating towards a migraine headache. however no diagnostic test can surely rule out a migraine. its diagnosis is mainly based on the symptoms. in a migraine there is no definite pain and pain occurs at any time. some people say that a migraine usually occurs on one side of the head and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting but this is not true in all cases. the pain can be all over the head and other symptoms might be present or absent. i suggest you try doing the following. wear sunglasses cover your head with a scarf and use an umbrella whenever you go out in the sun. before going outside always drink one glass of water it will keep you hydrated and will help you. you can take sandalwood oil and massage your scalp a night before washing your hair. avoid excessive intake of tea coffee and caffeinated drinks. some foods also increase the problem of headaches so avoid those. avoid using perfumes deodorant sprays etc. as strong smell may exaggerate the problem. avoid stress anxiety and loud noises. follow a particular sleep pattern i mean try to sleep daily around the same time. if possible try to avoid mobile television laptop etc. an hour before sleep as these emit blue light which hinders normal sleep pattern and also promotes headaches. pranayam is helpful in headaches. so if you can spare 5 to 10 minutes then practice it daily. in medications i suggest you try taking the following. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. pathyadi kwath 15 to 20 ml with an equal amount of water twice a day for six weeks. godanti bhasma 250 mg with water twice a day for four to six weeks. it is an ayurvedic painkiller. shir shuladi vajra ras two tablets twice a day with water for four to six weeks. this ayurvedic medicine is also a painkiller and is used in headaches of various etiology. if you find it tedious to take multiple medicines then you can take only one of these two painkillers or can take two of them for one month. kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a day with water for four to six weeks. it will help in cooling you down internally. take anu taila and put one drop of this oil in each nostril once a day for one month. take powder of sandalwood camphor and jatamansi and. mix all in equal amount and add water or rose water and apply this paste on the forehead while you have a headache. take one teaspoon of coriander powder and add it in one cup of water and keep it for a night. drink it early in the morning on an empty stomach. if you are taking allopathic medicine then take above medicine along with that after consulting your physician. however for a migraine there is no curative treatment. it can only be avoided with the help of medicines and lifestyle changes and sometimes the headache may not disturb you for so long and sometimes may trouble you often so follow a healthy way of life. also stop these medicines during your periods. you can start them after the period gets over. i hope you are satisfied with my answer. for further queries consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>
i feel a hole in the tooth after root canal treatment. should i worry about infection?,"After root canal surgery, I have a hole in my tooth.

my headache persists even after pituitary tumor surgery. what to do?,"And after surgery to remove a pituitary tumour, I still have a headache.

is headache a symptom of hiv?,Is a headache a sign of HIV infection?,i can understand your anxiety which is quite obvious in this situation. however transfer of the hiv virus through oral sex is low. but it depends on any cuts abrasion on your penis and any ulcer in her mouth. if this is possible then get a blood sample of her because that can be tested for hiv (human immunodeficiency virus). 14 days is a short period for acute hiv infection manifestation but still it is not a guarantee. if cost is not an issue then you can do hiv viral load which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. on personal ground i do not think that your symptoms are hiv related. these look more stress related. i will add that hiv is not the only infection you should be worried as you can get other std (sexually transmitted diseases) like hpv (human papilloma virus) syphilis and gonorrhea. as i said above you can do a hiv viral load test which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. also next time in addition to being careful i will say that you should present early because the drug useful for prevention is most active in the first 72 hours of exposure. for further information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>

can seizures be related to chronic sinusitis?,Is there a connection between seizures and chronic sinusitis?,we usually recommend antiepileptic if someone has two seizures within 24 hours. in approximately 70% cases we may not be able to identify any specific cause for seizures for example - infection stroke focal cortical dysplasia (fcd) and tumor as in your case. sinusitis is an incidental finding and at present it seems to be unrelated to epilepsy. you should complete antibiotic course as prescribed for its coverage. for epilepsy he will need antiepileptic drugs (aed). there are many aed to choose from but once you have been given keppra (levetiracetam) you can continue the same as it is a new generation drug with minimal side effects and drug interaction. with the limited information i have i would recommend starting it to prevent future seizures. your neurologist can provide you with its optimal dosing. high white blood cell (wbc) could be related to sinusitis or as a transient rise from seizure itself. it should come down by itself. it would be good to know how long his seizure was and what he did during his seizure. did he passed urine stool or bite his tongue during the episode? revert back with the asked details to a neurologist online --> <link>

i am getting erectile dysfunction as a side effect of dutasteride. please help.,"I'm getting erectile brokenness as a symptom of dutasteride. if it's not too much trouble, help.",drugs like dutasteride acts by inhibition of conversion of testosterone to its more active and potent form of dihydrotestosterone. thus the side effects may include loss of libido erectile dysfunction low mood irritability and depression. although the frequency of such adverse effects is not very high but they are potentially frustrating. sometimes reduced libido may not be due to a direct side effect of dutasteride but is purely psychological. but still if you have noted significant reduction in sexual desire and erection i suggest you stop the medication. with prolonged use the condition may be irreversible and no doubt that would be more troublesome than loss of hair. let me give you two tips for both the problems. apply onion juice on scalp daily. it has got miraculous effect. consume three garlic cloves raw and crushed daily. you can swallow it with water. within a month you will see drastic improvement in libido and erection. onion juice contains sulfur which increases production of keratin. garlic on the other hand cleanses fat and cholesterol deposition from smaller blood vessels thus improving erections by supplying more blood to the penile tissues. for further information consult a sexologist online --> <link>
kindly suggest ways to overcome migraine.,benevolently recommend approaches to conquer headache.,i clearly understand your symptoms. the basic reason behind the whole issue is the autonomic imbalance which your nervous system shows to specific sensory inputs. let me simplify that thing for you. all the senses give input to our brain like smell vision taste hearing and touch. out of these five the first two can have relatively major influence on our autonomic nervous system. the autonomic nervous system is the part of nervous system which regulates blood circulation digestion respiration cardiac rhythm etc. the alteration of blood flow in the brain produces those flashes of light and sometimes a lost patch of vision in a field. now people with migraine have little problem with these autonomic regulations and that is what is happening to you. the new smell is excessively disturbing your autonomic nervous system and so you have all the symptoms which you described. the olfactory system gets adapted relatively quickly. so if you continue to go there eventually you will get adopted. if that does not happen then you can use mechanical barriers such as a small mask to avoid the smell up to a certain extent but it may not help much. for nausea i suggest emefilm (ondansetron) 8 mg a thin mouth dissolving film of medicine to be kept below the tongue when you feel nauseated and topiramate 50 mg twice a day for headache. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. for further information consult a neurologist online --><link>
why should we avoid oral contraceptive pills after 40 years?,for what reason would it be advisable for us to keep away from oral preventative pills following 40 years?,natural estrogen is cardioprotective as it increases the level of hdl (high-density lipoprotein) and decreases the level of ldl (low-density lipoprotein). oxidation of ldl cholesterol is believed to be the initiator of atherosclerosis. estradiol and other estrogens are believed to inhibit this process. hormone replacement therapy - hrt rapidly increases the level of c-reactive proteins in the body a marker of inflammation associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. recently two major studies found that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer. another study proved that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of cardiac events and thrombosis. hence women should be advised to cease therapy postmenopause. however a detailed analysis showed that the time of initiating hrt postmenopause plays a crucial role. when initiated within five years of menopause in a healthy woman estrogen-based hrt has far more benefits than adverse outcomes. the pros of hrt includes: reduces symptoms of menopause. reduce osteoporosis dementia and colon cancer. improves cardiovascular system. the cons of hrt are: doubles the risk of thromboembolism. doubles the risk of breast cancer. so pros and cons are to be evaluated before initiating hrt in postmenopausal women. for more information consult a cardiologist online --><link>

i am 26 years old female who has ptsd bipolar and major depression. i also suffer from migraines anxiety and insomnia.,"I am a 26-year-old woman with ptsd, bipolar disorder, and major depression. In addition, I have migraines, anxiety, and insomnia. ",i read your concerns. i feel that topamax 200mg which works well for migraine has a little role in bipolar disorders. studies show that monotherapy with topamax is not recommended but instead of taking topamax you can try sodium valproate (depakote xr 750mg at night) which will be helpful to you in both your migraine and bipolarity. divalpoex sodium (depakote) has sedative property as a side effect. so it will be helpful to you in your insomnia. if you take 750 mg of dep. at night then you can reduce the night dosage of clonapin and gradually increase the dosage of depakote to 1000 mg and reduce the clonapin. you can also take 500mg in morning and 1000mg at night. and i feel that if you are feeling depressed then only you should take paxil otherwise there is no role of it in bipolar disorder. if your migraine is severe then you should take propranolol 10mg twice a day. but you have to take care about your heart because you complained about side effects of seroquel. propranolol is beta blocker it is used in prophylaxis for migraine. and i feel that if you use it you finally will get relief from your migraine. i do not know whether you have ever tried non benzos like zolpidem zopiclone eszopiclone. you should try that also for your sleep. i feel that these will satisfy some of your concerns. you can book for an online therapy at icliniq for further consultation with me either via video session or on phone.

i feel sleepy during office hours even after 8 hours sleep at night. please advice.,"Even after 8 hours of sleep at night, I feel sleepy during office hours. Please give me some advice. ",feeling sleepy during office timing is most commonly caused by absence of a sound sleep at night. sleeping for 8 hours during night not always means that you are having a healthy sleep. a healthy sleep is determined by the following factors: duration of the sleep. sleep-wake timings. number of awakenings during sleep at night. daytime sleepiness or drowsiness. any distress or dysfunction associated with sleep disturbances. as you told that you are sleeping for about 8 hours at night and your age is 24 years this is an adequate sleep at this age (6-8 hours). however if you still feel sleepy during your office hours this can be due to inadequate sleep in terms of quality of sleep. ensure that you are sleeping at an adequate time and getting up at adequate time in morning. no frequent awakening at night which reduces the quality of sleep. besides this few other things also hamper sleep quality such as: affective states anxiety states psychosis. endocrine disturbances such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. activating agents like tea coffee stimulant abuse. underlying physical illness. lack of interest in work boredom and burnout syndrome at work place also can cause sleepiness. i would recommend you a few changes that you can make at your work place such as make your work area more stimulating work in chunks take breaks in between your work do not work for long hours at a stretch drink water in between avoid too much tea/coffee in order to work continuously get involved in conversations in between for a while to refresh yourself. also try and maintain sleep hygiene at bed time. besides this if you continue to have this problem seek an opinion from a sleep medicine physician online get yourself evaluated for any of the above causes for sleep disturbances --> <link>

i got slight epidermal prick while tattooing. is the risk of infection high?,"While tattooing, I received a minor epidermal prick. Is there a high chance of infection?",there are lot of medical issues which can occur from tattooing like hiv infection tetanus hepatitis b and c and allergic reactions. nowadays tattooists reduced such risks by following universal precautions working with single use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. as you mentioned your piercing was done only till the epidermis the infection is highly unlikely (very very less chance) that you will contact any infection. even if the needle was infected it requires contact with body fluids like blood. so you can relax. still i would like to make the following points:- in case of an hiv infection the test takes about 2-3 months to be positive. hence there is no way to find out if you got infected which is again highly unlikely. there is something called post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) given to individuals who have been exposed to the virus and includes three drugs given only under doctor's supervision. you can discuss this with your doctor. if you frequently get a tattoo done make sure your tetanus and hepatitis b vaccines are up-to-date. always have clear knowledge about the infections spread by tattooing like hiv and hepatitis and their mode of spread. take care and stay safe. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>
we are not sure about my friend's diagnosis. kindly help.,My friend's condition is unknown to us. Please assist. ,one thing for sure is that he is having periodic hemolysis with adequate bone marrow response and he has a severe vitamin b12 deficiency. his corrected rpi (reticulocyte production index) is 2. 7% which means that his bone marrow is responding to the anemia appropriately. the broad differential here would be medication induced hypothyroidism vitamin b12 folate deficiency lead poisoning alcoholism and hemolysis due to ssd (sickle cell disease) or liver disease since he has transaminitis and elevated bilirubin. elevated ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) elevated reticulocyte count and low haptoglobin are indicators of hemolysis. he has splenomegaly as well which again favors either a chronic liver disease or most likely hemolysis. however the only tricky portion is his low wbc (white blood count). i do not think that it is a bone marrow process. it is more like peripheral destruction or nutritional deficiency. i do see that the vitamin b12 is very low at 209 and he has a normal g6pd level (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). i also reviewed that his bm was normal and his electrophoresis does not comment upon the sickle cell s or c disease. please mention whether he had any additional testing or work up for hemolytic anemia. i would like to know if he had a tsh done. why is he taking medications (all of them) including prednisolone azathioprine rituximab and mycophenolate? why is he not taking the vitamin b12 and vitamin d? these medications are toxic to bm and should not be used without a concrete diagnosis. revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online --> <link>

after receiving tattoo should i be concerned about hiv infection?,Should I be worried about contracting HIV after getting a tattoo? ,i have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. the conditions you have mentioned are not the risk factors for acquiring an hiv infection. the risk is there only if a drop of some hiv positive person's blood from the gun was transferred directly into your skin while tattooing. even then there is 3/1000 chances of you getting hiv from that drop of blood. so the probability of this happening is almost negligible. though hiv testing is not needed in your case but to relieve yourself from the associated anxiety you may get an elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for hiv test done after 12 weeks of possible exposure. the symptoms you have described are non-specific symptoms which can also be seen without any underlying cause and not indicative of hiv infection. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>

will irregular period affect my fertility?,Will my irregular cycle have an effect on my fertility?,all these problems of periods are due to overweight. your expected weight is around 55 kg to 60 kg. it is easy to say just to reduce. but it is quite impossible to reduce so much. please put some effort to do it for at least 2 to 5 kg per month. it is a start. reduce all high calories diet and junk bakery food. but you should not fast. have regular exercise especially for the middle segment of the body like aerobics or brisk walk. all the fat in the body gets converted to hormones. you would have seen big men having breast as their fat is producing the female hormone. this hormone will affect the normal cycle of ovulation and you will not get the periods regularly. your fat distribution will be mainly around mid-segment such as thighs breast back and hip but not below knees and elbows. also there will be black discoloration behind the neck side of breast and inner aspect of thighs. kindly get a scan to check polycystic ovaries. in the meantime also check your empty stomach early morning thyroid profile and serum prolactin. these hormones can also affect your periods and can be corrected. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
i touched a used needle. is there any chance of me getting hiv infection?,I came into contact with a discarded needle. Is there a risk I'll get infected with HIV? ,the risk of infection from needlestick injuries depends on: the factors that influence exposure to a greater volume of blood (for example: visible blood on the device needle which has been placed directly into an artery or a vein of an hiv positive person). viral load of the source patient. deeper injuries and by hollow-bore needles (especially those needles with larger gauges). diabetics use fine gauge needle and that too for injecting insulin into the skin rather than into a blood vessel. moreover the needlestick injury you have mentioned here actually did not prick deep enough you just touched the needle and i think your chances are minimal if at all. are you unsure about the hiv status of the patient? if you are sure that the used needle belongs to him and no one else and if you know the person very well you may straight away go and tell him/her about the incident and your reason to be anxious and inquire about the person's hiv status. that would be the easiest way. you may get a hiv combo test (antigen and antibody based test) done after 1 month of exposure for your own peace of mind. consult a hiv aids specialist online for further help --> <link>
how to correct vitamin b12 deficiency?,How can a vitamin B12 deficiency be remedied? ,i had gone through all the data posted. the treatment duration for b12 deficiency depends upon the cause severity and symptoms. for example vitamin b12 deficiency is common in strict vegetarians. so we advise them to take injection daily once intramuscularly for one week and then weekly once for four weeks and then monthly once in six months. if pernicious anemia is the cause where there is a defect in the absorption of vitamin b12 then we will advise to take the same course for a longer duration. it also depends up on the signs and symptoms like low hemoglobin neuropathy etc. so if you are a strict vegetarian or the cause of b12 deficiency has not been evaluated then i suggest tablet containing b12 1000 mcg weekly two days. kindly review with further details so that i can help you better. revert back with further doubts to an internal medicine physician online --> <link>

having dandruff and hairfall. suggest an ayurvedic procedure or medicine.,I have dandruff and hair loss. recommend an ayurvedic treatment or medication ,there are many reasons for dandruff. close examination can help diagnose the exact reason for dandruff. i am sharing some steps which usually help cure dandruff. use mahabhringraj oil (any good brand) at night to massage scalp with finger tips. saturate the scalp. on the next morning use herbal shampoo with minimal preservatives and chemicals. rinse thoroughly afterwards. remains of shampoo on the scalp also lead to white flakes on scalp. avoid using conditioner in fact you will not need it if you once started using maha bhringraj oil as said above. avoid using hair dryer. brush your hair regularly to remove any dead tissues. in routine use a light refined oil. if dandruff still persist consult a dermatologist online --> <link>
can pregnancy occur outside uterus?,Is it possible to get pregnant outside of the uterus? ,whatever your doctor said is true. but there is no need to be afraid. even when it is an ectopic pregnancy it can be managed efficiently with medicines or laparoscopy in the modern era. an ectopic pregnancy will not cause pain bleeding etc. unless it is about to rupture. the second possibility is that of late ovulation with multiple pregnancies. pregnancy in that case will be seen late on ultrasound. you can just repeat beta hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) after 48 hours to know about status and doctor will decide accordingly. the only caution is that if it turns out to be an ectopic pregnancy just follow your doctor's advice. for further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
can stress cause hair fall?,Is it true that stress causes hair loss? ,let me explain everything about hair fall. 100-150 hair fall every day is very normal. so it should be considered as hair loss only if the number of hair falls more than this. generalized hair fall in female is mostly due to stress poor sleep poor nutrition and excessive blood loss due to menstruation. stress alopecia is also common in which female keeps their hair very tight in certain manner which creates tension in root and cause hair fall. straightening and other procedure also cause weakness of root. other condition like fever typhoid malaria thyroid etc. can also cause hair fall but these are less common. regarding treatment have good sleep. eat proper food with green vegetables and fruits. take iron and multivitamin like follihair for at least three months. check your blood hemoglobin. if it is less then she should start iron and folic acid supplement. also check thyroid and diabetes to rule out other cause. for further information consult a dermatologist online --><link>

pregnancy tests are negative but am still having pregnancy symptoms. why?,"While my pregnancy tests have come back negative, I am still experiencing pregnancy symptoms. What is the reason for this? ",i understand your concern. i see two problems in your history. let me tell you the reason and solution. birth control pills come in a pack of 21 or 21 active plus seven dummy pills or the single dose of an emergency contraceptive pill. whichever you take will suppress your body's natural hormones. if you forget to take the pill in between or take it haphazardly your natural cycle is out of the track but do not worry as it can be corrected. get a urine pregnancy test done if not done recently. then have the same oral combined birth control pill (21 pills) twice a day for ten days and throw away the last pill. within next 7 to 10 days you will surely have your periods. all these bleeding on and off will disappear and then from the first day of the bleeding have the next packet of 21 pills once at night for 21 days. your bmi (body mass index) is more which is the bigger problem. from your history i presume you to have pcod (polycystic ovarian disease) this is usually associated with obesity irregular menstrual cycles no periods for few months followed by heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses spotting on and off. you develop an extra pad of fat around the mid segment of the body especially waist thighs and breast. excessive body hair growth hair fall dark lower half of the face acne oily face dark skin in the back of the neck inner thighs and under surface of the breast. pcos will not allow ovulation to occur at times and so you cannot get pregnant till treated. it also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. but this has a solution. just delay pregnancy for a few months as your weight has to be reduced. once you reduce your weight you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and the pregnancy will be healthy. i suggest you try the following to reduce weight. avoid fasting junk food and red meat. reduce snacks in between meals. have low calories and high-fiber diet. do regular exercise aerobics yoga and brisk walking. get your thyroid profile and serum prolactin test done in empty stomach. you can continue the same 21 pills packet to regularize periods till you shed some weight. try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. do not hurry on weight reduction as it will be difficult to maintain. as soon as you reduce at least 5 kg you will see changes. for further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
is hair fall common after a surgery?,Is it normal for hair to fall out after surgery? ,you are suffering from acute telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a self-limiting disorder and is very common after any surgical procedure. keep taking the multivitamins and there is no need for minoxidil because it is mainly for androgenic alopecia. if you applied it once then you need to apply it for the whole life. do not worry; the hair will return to normal within four to six months. so no active intervention is needed. for further information consult a dermatologist online --><link>

pregnancy test positive. on the 9th day had slight bleeding why?,A pregnancy test came out positive.

pregnancy tests were negative but i passed blood clots. what could it be?,"While my pregnancy tests were negative, I did pass blood clots.

why do i get attracted to both men and women?,Why do I find myself drawn to both men and women? ,i have gone through your query and understood your concerns. firstly if you feel attracted towards men and women both it is just your sexual orientation. it is not a disorder. the more you will try to get rid of these feelings the more they will disturb you. secondly entering the vagina is a very different feeling as compared to just rubbing it over the clitoris. your wife can best tell whether you penetrated her or not. if you wife is very sensitive you can give sufficient time in foreplay. rubbing followed by fingering and penetration should be the plan. this will solve the problem of tight muscles also. the head of the penis is always sensitive. if your penile foreskin is tight your surgeon can help. otherwise its normal to have a sensitive penile head. 40% sperm motility is not too low in my opinion you do not need any medication for it. slowly as you would be able to do intercourse properly your wife can conceive. gradually she can guide your penis into her vagina. hope this helps. for more information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>

how to judge a person wisely?,How do you make a wise judgement about a person? ,every person has numerous traits or habits. a person is sum total of his thoughts words and actions. when you think of judging a person it is making a global judgment. if you really need to be objective you need to judge a person's actions habits and thoughts individually. but i get what you mean to ask. here are my thoughts on it: judge a person by how much he contributes to the welfare of others. judge a person on the basis of his thoughts. it is only thought which defines an individual. judge a person by his actions in the past and present. judge on the basis of how he treats his subordinates because there is only way of treating the boss. judge on the basis of his behavior during crisis not when things are going great. judge on the basis of what he does for the welfare of others not on the basis of how much he earns. judge on the basis of his common sense not his qualifications. judge not on his looks but on how he makes others feel. another thing to note is that it is neither wise nor necessary to judge people all the time. no one has perfect judgment. because judgment is subjective and based only on available facts not on the whole truth. besides it can make us prejudiced unnecessarily. also people change with time. for further information consult a psychologist counsellor online --> <link>

could omeprazole cause changes in ecg and increase the heart rate?,Is it possible that omeprazole can cause ecg changes and a rise in heart rate? ,anxiety and panic are the first possibilities. sudden onset of palpitations is a very unusual sign of heart attack. none of the investigation and symptoms are compatible with the heart attack. although there are some ecg changes like q waves which can be present are indicative of heart damage in case of heart attack. but your echo is normal and so no need to worry at all. there is also t-wave insertion in lead 3 and non-significant elevation in avr. so given these changes i would advise for some stress test like treadmill test or stress thallium which you did not mention anything about. if you have not undergone it then you can have it to rule out the possibility of inducible ischemia. the qrs prolonging of such mild degree is not significant and this much variation may normally occur with different ecg. it is not very common with omeprazole. for further information consult a cardiologist online --><link>

i had a horrible panic attack two weeks ago. my arms and legs went numb. what can i do to stop this?,"Two weeks ago, I had a terrifying panic attack. My arms and legs started to tingle. What should I do to put an end to this? ",the treatment includes some medicines and psychotherapy. 1) medication includes antidepressants (ssri's tci) antianxiety drugs. it is better to see some doctor before taking any medicine as the best medication for your panic attacks will depend on a variety of factors like presenting symptoms co morbid disorders and treatment goals. 2) psychotherapy (cbt i. e cognitive behaviour therapy) treatment of panic attacks. cbt works to help the patient to change his thoughts and perceptions that are contributing to fear and anxiety. once you begin to accept panic attacks you can start to change the way you respond to them. for example instead of reacting to physical symptoms with nerve-racking thoughts such as ‚Äúi am losing control ‚Äù you can respond to them with increased calm and clarity. relaxation techniques such as deep breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga can be practised to help you get in touch with your relaxation response. repeating positive affirmations such as ‚Äúdespite my anxiety i accept myself ‚Äù can also help in getting past fear. by working on changing how you react you can start to remain in control during panic attacks. the next time you have a panic attack try to remember the three a‚Äôs of overcoming your fears: acknowledge accept and alternative response. these three steps can assist you in changing the way you react to symptoms and get through panic attacks with less fear. listed here is a simple step-by-step exercise that can help you overcome your fear of panic attacks: acknowledge - the next time you notice increased anxiety or panic symptoms simply pause and take a breath. take this moment to recognize that you are experiencing heightened panic and anxiety. this simple act of acknowledging your symptoms at the start of a panic attack can give you a sense of power over your fears. accept - rather than trying to run away from or resist your symptoms come to terms with the fact that you are having a panic attack. acceptance does not mean that you are giving in to panic but can provide you with the clarity needed to get through panic attacks. alternative response - instead of becoming wrapped up in your fear remind yourself that these are simply symptoms of a panic attack and that you have nothing to be afraid of. during a panic attack your flight-or-fight reaction may be trigger feelings of stress and fear. reframing these feelings can allow you to more effectively cope with them. so for example if during an attack you start to react with fear or a need to flee remind yourself that your symptoms will soon subside. instead of thinking ‚Äúi am afraid of my panic attack ‚Äù try to reframe this to ‚Äúi am feeling overly excited. ‚Äù when frightening thoughts such as ‚Äúi am going to lose my mind‚Äù arise try to shift this perception be repeating to yourself ‚Äúi am okay ‚Äù or ‚Äúthese feelings will pass. ‚Äù you can book for an online therapy or telephone counseling for further counseling and treatment from us.

can i conceive with adenomyosis?,Is it possible to conceive with adenomyosis? ,firstly let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. it cannot diagnose it. for diagnosis you have to send biopsy of the uterus. in adenomyosis there is pain before during and after menses. there is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. a few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. so just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. in fact if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. if you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. so do not worry and take chance for a year. if you do not get pregnant then consult a gynecologist as normal people. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --><link>

can i continue my pregnancy with a high tsh level?,"With a high tsh stage, can I continue my pregnancy? ",yes you are right. hypothyroidism can affect the fetal brain development especially in early pregnancy. thyroid hormone is normally very important for many functions of the body. it helps in the early development of the fetus. the brain is one of the parts of early organ development. in early pregnancy fetus mainly depends on mother's thyroid level because fetus itself cannot produce up to around 11 to 12 weeks (three months). there is no data available whether you have taken treatment early and adequately. but yes there is data that hypothyroidism can affect brain development and function in baby permanently and whatever damage occurs is irreversible. if you are taking thyroxine (levothyroxine) 50 mg and the level is this high then you need to increase the dose. and if you have started treatment just now then continue and repeat according to the doctor. as far as termination is concerned that is totally the couple's call. if you are prepared to take care of a mentally handicapped baby and related problems for the rest of life then you can definitely continue. if you are not prepared for that then you can go for termination. first control thyroid level and then try for pregnancy after you have a normal thyroid level. you will have to take tablets for hypothyroidism for the rest of your life. only dose adjustment will be required time to time according to the thyroid level. so the last choice is yours. you know what can happen. if you are ready for it then go for it and do whatever you have to minimize that. get treated for hypothyroidism more aggressively and control as early as possible. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

what is the recommended dose of folic acid while planning for pregnancy?,What is the recommended folic acid dosage when trying to conceive? ,i suggest you tablet folvite 5 mg of folic acid one tablet per day. the recommended dose of folic acid is a controversial topic. various doctors favor 1 mg to 5 mg per day. the best part is that the folic acid has no side effects. it is a water-soluble vitamin and an excess of it gets excreted in urine. so we recommend 5 mg per day to all our patients. when sufficient dose is harmless there is no need to take a chance by giving low doses. one more concern of mine is that you have to check with your neurologist if it is safe to go ahead with pregnancy while on lamictal (lamotrigine). the safety of lamictal is not established by studies. but if your physician has good experience with personal case series then i think you can continue. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>

does my ecg look like i have ever had a heart attack?,Is my ECG indicating that I've ever had a heart attack? ,it is good to see your detailed history for which i have asked for. firstly your ecg is perfectly normal. for anything to be wrong in case of ecg the changes should be present in at least two consecutive leads at a time. in your case whether it is a t-wave or q it is always there in one lead which does not signify anything. as your stress echo and all cardiac enzymes are normal (far superior to ecg in diagnosing a problem) you are cleared from cardiac side. secondly you say that you were prescribed statins (atorvastatin). one of the most common side effects of statins is myalgia (pain in a muscle or group of muscles). the generalized body ache and dull aching in nature is a characteristic feature of myalgia. i request you to consult your doctor and immediately stop atorvastatin. also get your liver function test done. kindly ask your doctor to shift you either on niacin or fenofibrate if you are intolerant to statin. ecg is always interpreted by a doctor. the machine most of the times provide us with artifacts. do not worry; your ecg is perfectly alright. from your history you have severe anxiety levels and attacks called panic attacks. every attack of panic disorder presents with same symptoms as you have mentioned. i can feel that you are obsessed by the thought that you are having any sort of a cardiac ailment. try to overcome your obsession. if you smoke or drink then stop it. try meditation for at least 30 minutes a day and do regular exercise. i suggest tablet paroxetine 12. 5 mg once daily for 21 days and tablet clonazepam 0. 5 mg once daily for 21 days for anxiety. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. panic disorder and your anxiety are induced by obsession and it needs to be treated. the probable causes:1. myalgia induced by statins. 2. panic disorders. 3. obsession induced anxiety. investigations to be done:liver function test. regarding follow up:for further information consult a cardiologist online. ---> <link>
should i avoid folic acid during mthfr pregnancy?,Is it safe to take folic acid during my mthfr pregnancy?,truly speaking mthfr - methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutations are widely spread and all most one half of the population is having or carrying these mutations by different extent. by different extent i mean to say various levels of affection or involvement that is from very insignificant disease to severe disease. i do want to know that in which category you are now. this is fairly judged by the serum levels of homocysteine which is the protein that is increased in the blood. if you have a severe mthfr defect then you need to avoid folic acid and also need to screen some fetal congenital defects like spina bifida or anencephaly at an earliest. but if you do not have any specific symptoms with this mutation then there is no harm to take these vitamins. pai mutations (plasminogen activator inhibitor) could result in abnormalities in blood clotting disorders. this actually poses no bar for taking folic acid in pregnancy state. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
suggest me any medicine and guide me reduce weight.,Please advise me on any medications I can take and how to lose weight. ,the best way to reduce weight is by regular physical exercise and balanced diet. you can lose weight by reducing your intake of oily food and sweets. it is also important to space your meals in such a way that you have more frequent small meals (and not heavy meals). regular physical exercise in the form of some cardio and strength training will make you fit and strong. sleep and hydration are equally important when you try to lose weight. ensure that you take lots of fluids and that you get at least 6-8 hours of sleep per day. medicine to lose weight: as a doctor i never really recommend my patients to take medicines to lose weight. only one drug is approved for use in india- orlistat. if you really want to take it you can take tablet orlistat 60mg thrice a day (after your 3 major meals). as i have seen in practice and also research results say that orlistat does not produce too much change in weight. it shows just a small percentage of weight loss when coupled with low-calorie diet and exercise. and orlistat has its own share of side effects: fatty/oily stool oily spotting intestinal gas with discharge a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away increased number of bowel movements or poor bowel control. rare but serious side effects can occur: symptoms of liver disease (such as persistent nausea/vomiting severe stomach/abdominal pain dark urine yellowing eyes/skin) symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain pain while urinating pink/bloody urine). bottom line: i do not recommend medicines for weight loss. i can make a good diet chart and exercise regimen for you if you would like to follow up in which case you will have to get back to me with your details- your daily food routine your work timings your daily sleep cycle the kind of exercises you prefer etc. i hope that answers your question. revert back to a fitness expert online --> <link>

i had unprotected sex. what are my chances of getting pregnant?,I had sex that was unprotected. What are my chances of conceiving a child? ,please do not be worried. you have done a right thing by taking i-pill within 72 hours of last sexual intercourse. you were not likely to menstruate on your actual due date simply because it takes about 5-7 days for bleeding to occur after taking i-pill. it is also a known side effect of i-pill that the following menses may be delayed or may be heavy. in case periods do not resume in the next 10 days then you must do a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. if the test comes as negative then please do not take any medication. just wait for your periods to return till then practise barrier contraception. if the test is positive which is unlikely though keeping in mind that i-pill does not cause any congenital abnormalities in fetus you would need to make an informed decision as to continue or terminate the pregnancy (which can be done by medical methods in early first trimester after ultrasound scan confirmation). things can be tackled at each step. so please do not panic stress per se can delay your menses further. try to keep yourself relaxed. consult a gynaecologist online for further follow up --> <link>

suffering from anxiety and depression. doctor prescribed mirap and clonazepam. need a second opinion.,Anxiety and depression are present. Mirap and clonazepam were recommended by the doctor. I'm looking for a second opinion.,"mirap is a mirtazapine which is indicated for depression. in my professional experience it is not as efficacious as the ssris such as fluoxetine or paroxetine or citalopram. mirap at the dosage of 15mg does help the patient to sleep better but it is also known for significant weight gain upto 10lbs in 2 weeks. clonazepam is indeed an useful adjunct and helps with the anxiety component. but i only prefer to use it as an ""as needed adjunct"" and no standing doses. i can help you better if you are fine with booking a session for an online therapy for a detailed evaluation."
